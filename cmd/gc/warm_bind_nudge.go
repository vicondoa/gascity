// cannot replay — the in-memory map of the reverted #312 idle nudger did not,
// which is precisely why that one re-nudge-stormed on every restart (test-5il). A
// fresh binding writes a different trigger id, so the marker mismatches and the
// nudge fires again: exactly once per binding. The legacy marker is read once

// deliverWarmBindClaimNudge delivers a pool slot's claim nudge to an already
// running, idle slot that had on-demand work bound to it (bindPoolSessionTriggerBead)
// after it was last Started. Cold Provider.Start delivers this nudge as a
// side-effect of spawning the agent; a warm slot is never re-Started (the
// reconciler observes it running & alive and returns without a Start), so without
// this it sits idle at its prompt with unclaimed work it never began. This is the
// event-based counterpart, fired from startPreparedStartCandidate's warm-reuse
// branch — symmetric with cold Start, not a separate poll.
//
// Provider-agnostic by design (it does NOT gate on Capabilities().CanReportActivity).
// The bind edge — warm slot + unclaimed bound trigger + marker mismatch — is the
// same on every runtime, and coupling delivery to that capability flag would
// silently disable the nudge the moment herdr starts reporting activity. On herdr
// this is the ONLY path that closes the warm-bind gap (its GetLastActivity is
// zero, so the idle-timeout relaunch net never fires). On tmux it composes with
// that existing net as the fast primary nudge: the idle-timeout relaunch (which
// re-delivers the claim nudge via cold Start) remains the slower backstop, and the
// two gates below keep them from double-acting — a claimed bead stops matching the
// probe, and the persisted marker stops the re-fire. Runtimes must provide a
// positive IdleWaitProvider confirmation; missing, blocked, or timed-out idle
// waits skip injection.
//
// Churn-free by the same construction that inverts every failure mode of the
// reverted #312 idle nudger, but simpler — it keys on two independent gates, so
// even a wrong marker cannot disturb a working slot:
//   - Bead state: nudge only while the trigger is unclaimed. The instant the slot
//     claims, the bead flips to in_progress and the probe returns false — the
//     nudge is structurally invisible to a working slot.
//   - Persisted once-per-binding marker: fires exactly once per binding and
//     cannot replay across a controller restart.
//
// The cheap in-memory gates (pool slot, bound trigger, marker) short-circuit first
// so a steady warm fleet pays nothing; the store read (unclaimed probe) and the
// idle wait run only on the tick(s) right after a new binding, before the marker
// is set. Best-effort throughout: it never fails the (already-successful) warm start.
